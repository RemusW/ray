Hello for this Ray Tracer 
Marlow and Remus worked on this together

Not many additional steps were really taken to build the project. Project was developed on Ubuntu.
Some things to note.
1) In glm.cmake I had to force cmake_policy (SET CMP0072 NEW) to run the the latest version of fltk
2) I was having troubles linking when doing "make -j8" so in build/src/CMakeFiles/ray.dir/link.txt I had to add some flags at the end of the txt. 
All the flags together looked like
    "-lX11 -lSM -lICE -lXrender -lXcursor -lXfixes -lXinerama -lXext -lm -ljpeg -ldl"
This needed to be redone everytime I ran cmake.
