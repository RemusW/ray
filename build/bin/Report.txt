    At the moment, we have the basic shading for surfaces implemented. We've taken a good look at implementing the trimesh code
    but decided to work on the shading first.

    Beginning of phong shading model is setup. At the moment I have code for the distance attenuation and shadow attenuation
    but my result seems to blow out my image.

Plans:
    We plan a set amount of hours each day
